## Data Lake vs Data Warehouse

A data warehouse is a database where data from different sys‐ tems is stored and modeled to support analysis and other activ‐ ities related to answering questions with it. Data in a data ware‐ house is structured and optimized for reporting and analysis queries.


A data lake is where data is stored, but without the structure or query optimization of a data warehouse.
